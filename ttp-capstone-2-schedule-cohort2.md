### Capstone 2: 

A low-stakes way to practice your tools so far.

# Capstone 2 Kickoff

The week of Monday, August 3rd will be devoted to executing, and presenting your own four-minute capstone slide presentation using work done in Pandas and/or Tableau.

# Data
Your data can be found here: (AirBnB Data)[http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html]

You can analyze any single city in the dataset. Please let me know which city you want to do so that I can monitor usage. If you want to analyze more than one city, please slack me a proposal for approval. 

Note: Some of these files are gzip-compressed csvs. Google and/or the pandas docs can help you figure out what to do with them.


## Schedule

The rough process for this is:
* Monday:
    * Identify your interests
    * Locate related data sources
* Tuesday:
    * Explore your data sources
    * Think of questions you could answer with the data
    * Scope your questions/point of view to be answerable in a few days
    * This might take more than one try!
* Wednesday:
    * Make your first draft presentation (4 minutes only)
* Thursday:
    * Deliver first draft presentation. Revise as needed.
* Friday:
    * Deliver final presentation (4 minutes only) presentation.


## Learning objectives: What you owe yourself

By the end of the week you should have increased your skill in:
* Obtaining data sources
* Converting your interests + data sources -> a specific question
* Scoping a project to fit within a certain amount of time
  * (No one is good at this)
* Attending daily check-in meetings
* Presenting by yourself on a deadline
* Note: Tableau Dashboards are a nice to have, but not required for Capstone 2!

This is not something we do for you. This is something that you do for yourself, by way of achieving the deliverables.

## Presentation Criteria:
* Your presentation should study the data from a point of view. For example, are you a host, are you a government thinking about adding regulation, are you a business thinking of competing against AirBnB in your target city, etc.

* Produce a 3-4 page presentation, excluding cover page,conclusion page, and an optional, clearly-marked appendix.
* Maximum of 3 graphs per page 
* Maximum ~50 words of text per slide
* Final presentation should take a MAXIMUM of four minutes
* Any final presentations above the max four (4) page limit and any final presentation that doesnâ€™t meet the other criteria listed above will be rejected!!!!!
